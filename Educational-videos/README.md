| 1  | This chapter will explain how to format a customer's need by structuring it with Sysml diagrams.  | [Chapter 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZZDJNnGtbw&ab_channel=MakAir-Projetopensource)  | [Terms of reference](https://github.com/makers-for-life/makair-cpap/tree/master/Conception-CPAP)   |
| 2  | This chapter will explain the MCSE approach and how to use it to define the different I/O and system functions. |[Chapter 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaCOPvmWCng&t=80s&ab_channel=MakAir-Projetopensource) | [MCSE](https://github.com/makers-for-life/makair-cpap/tree/master/Conception-CPAP)  |
| 3  | This chapter will explain how to choose the right components for each functional block defined above. Explain some important parameters to consider when choosing components. |  | [Technological Choice](https://github.com/makers-for-life/makair-cpap/tree/master/Conception-CPAP)  |
| 4  | This chapter will explain why it is absolutely necessary to read the component datasheets and how this will allow us to have an electronic base of the system (definition of the pins for each component + realization of the electronic circuits).  |  |  |
| 5  | This chapter will explain how to connect the components, how to integrate the power supply into the system and how to think about the order of components to run as you prototype.  |   |  |
| 6  | This chapter will explain how to define unit tests for each component to validate their operation against the requirements of the specifications.  |  |[Unit tests](https://github.com/makers-for-life/makair-cpap/blob/master/Conception-CPAP/Tests_PPC.pdf)  |
| 7  | This chapter will explain what an IDE is, the different steps between the Arduino code and the binary file for the microcontroller and how to configure a compiler. |   | [Tuto STM32duino](https://github.com/makers-for-life/makair-cpap/blob/master/Educational-videos/Educational-sheets/Tuto_stm32duino.pdf)  |
| 8  | This chapter will explain how the blower works, the programming to make it work and the unit tests of the component. |  | [Blower](https://github.com/makers-for-life/makair-cpap/blob/master/Educational-videos/Educational-sheets/Ptech_Blower.pdf)  |
| 9  | This chapter will explain how the flow meter works, the programming to make it work and the unit tests of the component.  |   | [Flow meter](https://github.com/makers-for-life/makair-cpap/blob/master/Educational-videos/Educational-sheets/Ptech_debitmetre.pdf)  |
| 10  | This chapter will explain how the pressure sensor works, the programming to make it work and the unit tests of the component. |   | [Pressure Sensor](https://github.com/makers-for-life/makair-cpap/blob/master/Educational-videos/Educational-sheets/Ptech_capteur_pression.pdf)  |
| 11  | This chapter will explain how to set up an HMI.  |   |  |
| 12  | This chapter will explain the integration (electronics and software) of each component seen previously to realize the prototype of the PPC ventilator. |  | [Integration](https://github.com/makers-for-life/makair-cpap/blob/master/Educational-videos/Educational-sheets/Ptech_Integration.pdf) |
| 13  | This chapter will explain the different parts to model and print in order to have a more presentable and usable prototype during its operation. |   | [Parts](https://github.com/makers-for-life/makair-cpap/tree/master/Parts-CPAP) |
| 14  | This chapter will explain how to model each 3D part in FreeCAD.  |  |  |
| 15  | This chapter will explain the parameters to configure when printing the part modeled with Ultimaker Cura. |  |   |
| 16  | This chapter will focus on the integration of all the printed parts on the prototype to form a presentable and usable system.  |   |   |
| 17  | This chapter will explain how to program a simple PPC mode in order to have a system that meets the specifications. |   | [Firmware](https://github.com/makers-for-life/makair-cpap/tree/master/Firmware-CPAP)  |
| 18  | This chapter will highlight the validation of the system according to the specifications, solve some problems and optimize the system.  |  |  |
| 19  | **Conclusion** |  |  |
